Little Thunder

Welcome! This is my bot, Little Thunder. He's a tabletop RPG utility bot for use with Discord, mostly designed around Play-by-Post styled games. Below, I'll give an overview of the command groups you can use with him.

DM
---

The `.dm` family of commands is very simple; there are only two subcommands.

`.dm add` is the first subcommand, which sets the user who initiates the command as the Owner for the category of channels that the command is used within.

`.dm remove` is the other, which can be used by either the existing DM for a category or an administrator, and removes the user as a registered DM.

Initiative Tracker
---

Next, we've got our initiative tracking. These are handled by the `.init` command group.
